#This is a comment! This file will print hello world
#when opening the python shell, hit the file tab > new file to begin
#once you're ready, click run > run module

print ("Hello World!")


#Python 2 does not use these parenthesis
#Python2 sytax: print "Hello World!"

#Can use single or double quotes

print('Hello World!')

#Combining strings

print("This is " + 'a string')

#strings must start and end with the same quotes
#strings that don't raise a syntax error
#strings with no quotes raise a name error. Python thinks you are running a
#command like the 'print' command, and doesn't know what it means.
