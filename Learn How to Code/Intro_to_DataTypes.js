// In computing, data is the pieces of information that we use to build programs,
// like the numbers in a calculation, or the text printed to a screen.

// Data types are exactly what they sound like: different types of data. 
// Data types tell us about the data, including how it can be stored and what types of operations we can perform. 

//Primitives are the most basic data types, so basic that you can find them in pretty much every programming language. 
//Some examples of primitives: Numbers, Strings, Boolean values (True or False)

//Numbers are the original data type. The earliest computers communicated only in numbers, using binary computation.
//Numbers allows us to write programs that store values, count, and make calculations

//anything can be a string. they are typically used to represent text or speech
//even if a number looks like a number, or a boolean looks like a boolean, it’s good to check that it’s not a string 
//— or else you won’t be able to use it correctly!

//The string '20' is different from the numerical value of 20. 
// While they appear to be the same, a computer would see the first as two characters: '2' and '0',
// while the second contains the numerical value of 20.

//Booleans, unlike numbers or strings, only have two values: true and false. 
//The term boolean comes from the inventor of a specific form of logic, George Boole. 
//we can think of them in a myriad of ways, like on and off, yes and no, sometimes even 1 and 0.
