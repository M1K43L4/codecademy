//a variable is a way of saving a piece of information with a specific name. 
//By giving a value a name, we can easily reuse that value over and over again in our code. 
// variables are to:  reuse a value ; change a value

//When we use a value without assigning it to a variable, that’s known as hardcoding. 
//While it’s sometimes faster to initially hardcode values in your program, 
//in the long run you’ll run into trouble — especially if you need to change what those values are.

//We create or declare a variable by giving it a name and setting it equal to a value.

// declare variable one
// set it equal to the value 'grass'

one = 'grass'


// declare variable two
// set it equal to the value 'rocks'

two = 'rocks'

// declare variable three
// set it equal to the value 'forest'

three = 'forest'
